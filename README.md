# 💻 100 Days of Code – Melissa Aoko

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! I'm using this repository to document my journey of learning Python, Java, and SQL with the goal of becoming a proficient software developer. Each day, I focus on one or more concepts and practice them through coding challenges, projects, and learning resources.

I'll be updating this README with my progress and showcasing small projects and exercises I complete.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Daily Coding**: Code for at least 1 hour every day (May–September 2025).
- **Language Focus**: 
  - **Python**: Master scripting, libraries, and frameworks.
  - **Java**: Strengthen OOP principles and Java development.
  - **SQL**: Improve database querying, data manipulation, and optimization.
- **LeetCode Challenges**: Solve 3–5 problems weekly.
- **Projects**: Build small projects in Python, Java, and SQL to showcase practical application.
- **Internship Preparation**: Become interview-ready for software engineering roles by September.
