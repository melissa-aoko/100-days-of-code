# üíª 100 Days of Code ‚Äì Melissa Aoko

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! I'm using this repository to document my journey of learning Python, Java, and SQL with the goal of becoming a proficient software developer. Each day, I focus on one or more concepts and practice them through coding challenges, projects, and learning resources.

I'll be updating this README with my progress and showcasing small projects and exercises I complete.
